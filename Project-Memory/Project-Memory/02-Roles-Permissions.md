## CRM Lead Division Access Rules (New Meeting Requirements)
- **Role Restriction:** The "Receptionist / Sales Staff" (Sales Agent) must have a restricted sidebar view. Sidebar menus for plans, billing, and settings will be hidden when a user with this role logs in.
- **Lead Isolation:**
  - Sales agents can only query and view leads that are explicitly assigned to them in the database (`leads.assignedToStaffId = staff.id` of the logged-in sales agent).
  - The Super Admin or Gym Owner has the overall view to distribute/allocate total leads among different agents.

---

## Super Admin RBAC (Sub-Admin Permissions)
- **Goal:** Allow Super Admin to securely delegate tasks without exposing financial data or full control.
- **Role:** Sub-Admin / Super Admin Assistant.
- **Logic:** 
  - Sub-Admins have a `permissions` array or JSON column in the database.
  - Super Admin can check/uncheck available modules (e.g., Dashboard, Leads, Plans, Branches, Payments).
  - Sub-Admin sees ONLY the menus ticked in their permissions checklist. Access to unchecked routes is blocked at the frontend and backend levels.
